432,Space 1,Align 3rd parties,Align dependencies across products,AS,PE*UD,[00:20:25] there are some requirements to align the dependencies across the all or some products like EAP and some other. So this is usually done at the upstream at sort of to have the same versions but sometimes done only in productization phase. ,,,

45,Space 2,Attach builds to errata,Attach build to errata advisory,EN,PE,[00:42:44] Once we attach our builds to advisory they are there are some processes going on the background for example various tests and checks running on these builds. It's much more easier to see the outcome of these checks if they only RPM or say containers for example. ,,,
50,Space 2,Attach builds to errata,Add bugs to errata advisories,EN,PE,[00:47:05] They're created and we add content to them. We add builds and we add bugs. That's what we do. ,,,

So When that, that already has enough features for us to use to for example get [?] for CEPH up in brew. We're gonna be experimenting with that for CEPH 3.3 When that comes out. 3.2 Configuration hasalready been set. So if goes well then hopefully we can see that more widespread across release engineering ",,,

So you have to be careful which things are changed when... and A lot of that knowledge is captured in the engineer's brain and not in process documents.,,,

And a good RCM engineer would say like ""well hold on here. You need to re ask some questions about ask some questions about that"" but they can also be like ""Here's the docs and here's in particular and the documentation of where that particular question is addressed"" and it so happens that all the rest of the stuff you're going to have to do associated with that, is also addressed in this doc.",,,

You can't do it in one step because you can't create the delivery repositories before you create the build repositories.
